    <p>The digital divide is the unequal access to digital technology, including smartphones, tablets, laptops, and the internet.[1] The digital divide creates a division and inequality around access to information and resources.[1] In the Information Age in which information and communication technologies (ICTs) have eclipsed manufacturing technologies as the basis for world economies and social connectivity, people without access to the Internet and other ICTs are at a socio-economic disadvantage, for they are unable or less able to find and apply for jobs, shop and sell online, participate democratically, or research and learn.[2]</p>
