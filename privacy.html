        <p>In the late 19th century, the invention of cameras spurred similar ethical debates as the internet does today. During a seminar of Harvard Law Review in 1890, Warren and Brandeis defined <b>privacy</b> from an ethical and moral point of view to be:
    
            "central to dignity and individuality and boyhood. <b>privacy</b> is also indispensable to a sense of autonomy â€” to 'a feeling that there is an area of an individual's life that is totally under his or her control, an area that is free from outside intrusion.' The deprivation of <b>privacy</b> can even endanger a person's health."[2]
            Over 100 years later, the internet and proliferation of private data through governments[3] and ecommerce is an area which requires a new round of ethical debate involving a person's <b>privacy</b>.
            
            <b>privacy</b> can be decomposed to the limitation of others' access to an individual with "three elements of secrecy, anonymity, and solitude."[4] Anonymity refers to the individual's right to protection from undesired attention. Solitude refers to the lack of physical proximity of an individual to others. Secrecy refers to the protection of personalized information from being freely distributed.
            
            Individuals surrender private information when conducting transactions and registering for services. Ethical business practice protects the <b>privacy</b> of their customers by securing information which may contribute to the loss of secrecy, anonymity, and solitude. Credit card information, social security numbers, phone numbers, mothers' maiden names, addresses and phone numbers freely collected and shared over the internet may lead to a loss of <b>privacy</b>.
            
            Fraud and impersonation are some of the malicious activities that occur due to the direct or indirect abuse of private information. Identity theft is rising rapidly due to the availability of private information in the internet. For instance, seven million Americans fell victim to identity theft in 2002, and nearly 12 million Americans were victims of identity theft in 2011 making it the fastest growing crime in the United States.[5] Public records search engines and databases are the main culprits contributing to the rise of cybercrime. Listed below are a few recommendations to restrict online databases from proliferating sensitive personnel information.</p>
